<h1>Simple Game</h1>
<div>
This is a bubble game where the goal is to try to pop all of the bubbles in
30 seconds and at each level there are more bubbles and they move more quickly.
You pop the bubbles by blowing through a straw which you can rotate left and right
using keypresses (e.g. A and D) and you can puff a rapid burst of air with the space bar.
